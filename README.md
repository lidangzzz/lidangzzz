  - Matrix operations, operator overloads (with Babeljs plugin support)

  - Cross-platform GPU acceleration in browser with WebGL2

  - TeX and Markdown

Try it now at [hedgehog-lab.github.io](hedgehog-lab.github.io)

**3. Hedgehog Book [https://github.com/lidangzzz/Hedgehog-Lab-Tutorial](https://github.com/lidangzzz/Hedgehog-Lab-Tutorial)** - An interactive book that introduces features with examples. Here is a chapter for demo: [https://hedgehog-book.github.io/tutorials/matrix-operations.html](https://hedgehog-book.github.io/tutorials/matrix-operations.html)

**4. Hedgehog Package Manager [https://github.com/Hedgehog-Computing/Hedgehog-Package-Manager](https://github.com/Hedgehog-Computing/Hedgehog-Package-Manager)** - A package manager that allows user to import any package/module/function without installation or configuration, with only one line at beginning:

```js
*import My_Package: Function_A, Function_B, Class_C, Variable_D
```
